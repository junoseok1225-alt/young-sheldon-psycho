    <h3>Behaviourist Approach</h3>
    <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91I6U+Xy+RL._AC_SY679_.jpg" alt="Sheldon Behaviourist">
    <p>
      The behaviourist approach focuses on observable behaviour and how it is shaped by reinforcement, punishment, and conditioning. In *Young Sheldon*, these ideas appear constantly. When Sheldon answers questions correctly in class and receives praise from teachers, this positive reinforcement strengthens his motivation to perform academically. When he is scolded for arrogance, he sometimes adjusts his tone, showing how punishment influences his social interactions. Sheldon's parents also use rewards — such as allowing him to read extra science books or stay up later — to encourage compliance at home. His repetitive routines, such as strict meal schedules and a preference for specific spots at the dinner table, can be explained by conditioning, as consistent rewards and predictability make him feel secure. Even his emotional reactions — happiness when praised and frustration when corrected — are examples of learned responses through operant conditioning. By applying the behaviourist approach, we see how Sheldon’s intellectual habits and quirks are not only innate but continuously reinforced by his environment and experiences.

  <!-- Social Learning -->
  <div id="social" class="approach">
    <h3>Social Learning Approach</h3>
    <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Yh7z5mPzL._AC_SY679_.jpg" alt="Sheldon Social Learning">
    <p>
      The social learning approach, developed by Albert Bandura, highlights learning through observation, imitation, and modelling. Sheldon’s behaviour shows this vividly. He observes others — his parents, teachers, and brother — and integrates aspects of their behaviour into his own life. For example, Sheldon often imitates his father’s logical reasoning or his mother’s moral values. When he watches others receive praise for kindness or cooperation, he may later replicate those behaviours to gain approval. This type of vicarious reinforcement demonstrates how learning occurs indirectly. Sheldon’s interest in great scientists like Einstein or Hawking also illustrates modelling — he internalises their traits of curiosity and persistence. Through imitation, Sheldon learns not only academic content but also social norms, although he sometimes misapplies them due to his literal thinking. The social learning theory thus provides insight into how Sheldon acquires both intellectual and social behaviours by watching and interpreting the actions of those around him.

  <!-- Biological -->
  <div id="biological" class="approach">
    <h3>Biological Approach</h3>
    <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81F+8fYQpZL._AC_SY679_.jpg" alt="Sheldon Biological">
    <p>
      The biological approach explains behaviour in terms of genetics, brain structure, and neurochemistry. Sheldon’s extraordinary intellect is a clear reflection of biological factors, suggesting an inherited predisposition for high intelligence. His rapid problem-solving ability, exceptional memory, and capacity for abstract reasoning indicate advanced neural development. Sheldon’s sensory sensitivities — for example, discomfort with loud noises or unfamiliar textures — might stem from differences in brain processing, showing how neurobiology affects perception and emotion. Even his need for control and routine may relate to the brain’s preference for predictability and reduced stress response. Research on intelligence heritability supports the idea that certain traits, such as Sheldon’s analytical ability, are strongly influenced by genetics. However, his biological potential flourishes due to a nurturing environment that encourages academic exploration. The biological approach therefore emphasizes how Sheldon’s brain and genes work in tandem with his experiences to create his prodigious intellect and distinctive personality.

  <!-- Psychodynamic -->
  <div id="psychodynamic" class="approach">
    <h3>Psychodynamic Approach</h3>
    <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81GqKKrM2nL._AC_SY679_.jpg" alt="Sheldon Psychodynamic">
    <p>
      The psychodynamic approach, founded by Sigmund Freud, emphasizes unconscious desires, early childhood experiences, and inner conflicts. Sheldon’s strong need for order and control may reflect unconscious attempts to manage anxiety or maintain security. His relationship with his parents also influences his behaviour: he seeks his mother’s approval and struggles to understand his father’s more relaxed attitude, suggesting an internal conflict between obedience and independence. Freud’s concepts of the id, ego, and superego can also explain Sheldon’s actions. His id pushes him toward intellectual satisfaction and self-gratification, his superego imposes moral and parental expectations, and his ego mediates between the two, balancing logic and emotion. Sheldon’s occasional emotional outbursts or rigid routines can be seen as defence mechanisms that help him cope with stress. The psychodynamic perspective highlights that his intellectual brilliance is not only a product of intelligence but also a psychological response to deep internal motivations and early family dynamics.

  <!-- Cognitive -->
  <div id="cognitive" class="approach">
    <h3>Cognitive Approach</h3>
    <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81nktJ5Gk-L._AC_SY679_.jpg" alt="Sheldon Cognitive">
    <p>
      The cognitive approach focuses on internal mental processes such as memory, perception, and problem-solving. Sheldon’s advanced thinking skills make him an ideal example of cognitive development. His ability to analyse information, make predictions, and solve abstract problems reflects highly efficient cognitive processing. He uses schemas — mental frameworks — to understand the world, although these schemas are often rigid, leading to misunderstandings of social norms. For instance, Sheldon interprets language literally because his mental schema for communication is based on logic, not emotion. His scientific reasoning and quick recall demonstrate exceptional working memory and long-term information organization. Yet, his difficulty empathising or adapting to unexpected changes shows the limits of his cognitive flexibility. The cognitive approach helps us appreciate how Sheldon’s brain processes information in unique ways, showing both the strengths and weaknesses of an exceptional yet structured mind.
