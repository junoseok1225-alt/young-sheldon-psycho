  <!-- Approaches -->
  <div id="behaviourist" class="approach">
    <h3>Behaviourist Approach</h3>
    <p>
      The behaviourist approach focuses on observable behaviour and how it is influenced by the environment through conditioning, rewards, and punishments. In the case of Young Sheldon, his behaviours provide many clear examples of how learning can occur through reinforcement. For instance, in school, Sheldon demonstrates a strong desire to gain approval from teachers when he answers questions correctly or completes complex assignments. Each time he receives praise or a reward, he is more likely to repeat that behaviour, which illustrates classical and operant conditioning principles. Additionally, Sheldon often reacts negatively when corrected or disciplined, showing how punishment can suppress undesirable behaviours. At home, Sheldon's parents sometimes use rewards to encourage compliance, such as giving him extra privileges for completing chores or adhering to family routines. Observing these patterns allows us to understand how external stimuli shape his behaviour consistently. Even when Sheldon struggles with social interactions, his observable responses to different rewards and consequences highlight the fundamental ideas of behaviourism: behaviour is learned, measurable, and dependent on environmental factors rather than internal mental states. By applying behaviourist principles, we see that Sheldon's habits, routines, and reactions are all influenced by his past experiences with reinforcement and punishment, making him a compelling case study for understanding the approach in real life.

  <div id="social" class="approach">
    <h3>Social Learning Approach</h3>
    <p>
      The social learning approach emphasizes learning through observation, imitation, and modelling rather than solely through direct reinforcement. Young Sheldon provides numerous examples of this type of learning. For instance, Sheldon often observes his older brother, George, or his parents, noting how they solve problems, react to social situations, and communicate with others. He frequently attempts to imitate their behaviour to fit in or demonstrate his own intelligence. A classic example occurs when Sheldon copies George Sr.’s method of explaining complex topics logically to assert his knowledge in class or at home. He also observes his peers and adapts behaviours to achieve similar results, demonstrating vicarious learning. Social learning theory explains that observing the consequences of others’ actions informs Sheldon about which behaviours are effective or socially acceptable. In addition, Sheldon learns subtle social cues by watching his family, such as the appropriate tone of voice or gestures to express frustration or excitement. This approach is particularly useful for understanding Sheldon's social development because it highlights that he doesn’t just respond to direct consequences, but also to the actions of others around him, which shape his understanding of social norms, learning strategies, and problem-solving techniques. Through careful observation and imitation, Sheldon integrates these behaviours into his own repertoire, showing how social learning significantly contributes to his intellectual and social growth.

  <div id="biological" class="approach">
    <h3>Biological Approach</h3>
    <p>
      The biological approach examines how genetics, brain structures, neurochemistry, and innate abilities influence behaviour. Young Sheldon demonstrates several characteristics that can be explored from a biological perspective. His high intelligence and remarkable memory, for example, suggest strong genetic influences and neurodevelopmental factors. Sheldon’s capacity to retain large amounts of information, solve advanced mathematical problems, and recall complex scientific concepts at a young age is likely tied to his cognitive and neural development, highlighting the interaction between nature and nurture. Furthermore, biological explanations can be applied to his emotional responses, sensory sensitivities, and need for order, which may reflect innate predispositions. Neurochemical and neurological factors also contribute to how he processes information rapidly, demonstrates logical reasoning, and approaches problem-solving in a highly analytical manner. By examining Sheldon biologically, we gain insight into why certain behaviours, such as his focused attention on intellectual tasks, adherence to routines, and specific social behaviours, appear so pronounced compared to peers. Understanding the biological underpinnings of Sheldon’s behaviours allows us to appreciate the role of inherited traits, neural efficiency, and brain function in shaping his remarkable cognitive abilities and consistent behavioural patterns.

  <div id="psychodynamic" class="approach">
    <h3>Psychodynamic Approach</h3>
    <p>
      The psychodynamic approach, founded by Freud, emphasizes unconscious drives, early childhood experiences, and the influence of family dynamics on behaviour. Young Sheldon provides compelling examples of psychodynamic principles in action. His need for order, strict adherence to routines, and occasional anxiety in social situations can be interpreted as manifestations of unconscious conflicts and early family experiences. Sheldon’s relationship with his parents and siblings profoundly affects his behaviours; for example, his desire to excel academically may stem from internalized parental expectations and his unconscious drive for approval and validation. Freud’s concepts of the id, ego, and superego can also be seen in Sheldon’s decision-making: his id desires personal gratification, such as indulging in interests he enjoys, while the superego imposes moral rules learned from parents, and his ego mediates between the two. Sheldon’s obsessive routines and compulsive tendencies might represent a coping mechanism to manage anxiety and unconscious tension. By exploring his behaviours psychodynamically, we gain insight into how his past experiences, unconscious motivations, and family dynamics contribute to observable traits, emotional regulation, and social interactions. This approach helps explain why Sheldon’s behaviour sometimes appears rigid or socially awkward while being internally meaningful and psychologically adaptive.

  <div id="cognitive" class="approach">
    <h3>Cognitive Approach</h3>
    <p>
      The cognitive approach examines internal mental processes such as thinking, memory, problem-solving, and decision-making. Young Sheldon is an excellent example of how cognition shapes behaviour. His advanced reasoning skills, ability to plan experiments, and methodical problem-solving demonstrate the impact of mental processes on daily actions. Sheldon’s thought patterns guide his responses to social situations, academic challenges, and personal interests. For instance, he carefully calculates outcomes before acting, analyzes complex concepts in detail, and systematically applies logic to
