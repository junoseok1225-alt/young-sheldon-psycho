    <h3>Behaviourist Approach</h3>
    <p class="lead">How rewards, punishments, and conditioning shape Sheldon’s actions.</p>

    <p>
      The behaviourist approach explains behaviour in terms of what is observable and measurable: actions that increase or decrease in frequency because of their consequences. 
      In <em>Young Sheldon</em>, praise from teachers after a correct answer functions as positive reinforcement, making it more likely he will volunteer in future lessons and persist with difficult problems. 
      At home, access to favoured activities—extra time with science books, permission to run an experiment, choosing dinner—often follows cooperation with chores or family rules. 
      These contingent rewards strengthen compliance without needing to appeal to emotions or abstract reasoning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Operant conditioning also helps us understand what Sheldon avoids.  
      When sarcasm earns disapproval or when pedantic corrections upset his siblings, the social “punishment” temporarily suppresses those responses. 
      Teachers sometimes remove privileges (negative punishment), and Sheldon learns to moderate behaviours that cause conflict. 
      Over time, stimulus control emerges: certain contexts (a physics lab, the dinner table, church) cue different behavioural repertoires because of their histories of reinforcement and reprimand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Classical conditioning appears in his strong preferences and aversions. 
      Predictable routines paired with calm evenings make order itself feel comforting, whereas unexpected noise or messy environments are associated with stress, eliciting anxiety even before anything objectively “bad” happens. 
      Token-like systems—stickers, praise points, or simply nods from trusted adults—act as conditioned reinforcers that maintain his meticulous study habits.
    </p>
    <p>
      A behaviourist analysis neither denies genetics nor inner thoughts; it simply shows how consequences in Sheldon’s world shape what he actually does. 
      It explains why his intellectual behaviours are so persistent: they have been richly and consistently rewarded across settings for years. 
      Limitations remain—behaviourism struggles to account for his private thoughts or sudden insights—but as a lens on day-to-day actions, it reveals how environments train even a prodigy.

    <h3>Social Learning Approach</h3>
    <p class="lead">Learning by watching models and the power of vicarious reinforcement.</p>

    <div class="gallery">
      <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Yh7z5mPzL._AC_SY679_.jpg" alt="Sheldon portrait" loading="lazy">

    </div>

    <p>
      Bandura’s social learning theory proposes that people acquire new behaviours by observing others, forming mental representations, and later reproducing the behaviour when motivated. 
      Sheldon constantly watches powerful models: parents who value honesty and hard work, teachers who celebrate curiosity, and older peers who navigate the social jungle of school. 
      When he sees someone praised for kindness or for explaining an idea clearly, he is more likely to attempt those behaviours himself—this is <em>vicarious reinforcement</em>. 
      Likewise, he notices when sarcasm or rudeness draws negative reactions, and he sometimes modifies his delivery to avoid those consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      The classic four processes—attention, retention, reproduction, and motivation—are easy to spot. 
      Sheldon pays intense attention to how experts speak, remembers phrases and procedures with precision, and practices until he can reproduce them fluently. 
      Motivation comes from both external approval and an internal self-image: he wants to be the kind of person his intellectual heroes would respect. 
      Over time this builds <em>self-efficacy</em>—belief that he can master difficult tasks—which further increases his willingness to try challenging problems or public speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Role models are not limited to adults. 
      Siblings and friends provide scripts for humour, negotiation, and teamwork that Sheldon experiments with (sometimes awkwardly) and refines through feedback. 
      Media models also matter: biographies and documentaries supply behavioural templates—persistence after failure, meticulous note-keeping, ethical responsibility—that he imitates in school projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Social learning clarifies why Sheldon can improve at social behaviour without explicit instruction: he internalises what he sees working for others. 
      The approach also highlights limits: if a model’s behaviour clashes with his values or yields unclear outcomes, Sheldon is unlikely to adopt it. 
      Still, as a bridge between behaviour and cognition, social learning explains how observation becomes practice—and practice becomes habit.

    <h3>Biological Approach</h3>
    <p class="lead">Genes, brain systems, and physiology that support Sheldon’s abilities and sensitivities.</p>

    <div class="gallery">

    </div>

    <p>
      A biological lens explains Sheldon’s behaviour using genetics, brain development, and neurochemistry. 
      His exceptional memory, abstract reasoning, and rapid learning suggest a highly efficient neural architecture—particularly in networks supporting working memory and executive function. 
      Research on intelligence indicates substantial heritability; in fictional terms, Sheldon likely inherited alleles that bias development toward strong analytical skills and curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sensory processing also stands out. 
      He is unusually sensitive to sound, texture, and unpredictability, which may reflect heightened reactivity in sensory cortices and stress-response systems. 
      Routine, therefore, functions not only as preference but as physiological regulation: predictable environments minimise arousal, allowing cognitive resources to stay focused on complex tasks. 
      Sleep, nutrition, and arousal level further modulate his performance; when these are optimal, his problem-solving speed and accuracy soar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neurotransmitter systems play a role in reward and learning. 
      Scientific discovery and correct solutions likely trigger robust dopaminergic signals, making intellectual exploration intrinsically rewarding. 
      The prefrontal cortex supports planning and rule-based reasoning—strengths that characterise Sheldon’s approach to life—while connectivity with limbic areas influences his emotional tone and occasional rigidity when plans change suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Importantly, biology is not destiny. 
      Gene–environment interaction is clear in Sheldon’s story: a supportive family, access to mentors, and rich educational materials amplify his biological potential. 
      The biological approach explains the <em>capacity</em>—why high performance is possible—and why certain environments feel overwhelming. 
      It does not, by itself, explain everything he chooses to do; for that, we combine it with learning and cognitive perspectives.

    <h3>Psychodynamic Approach</h3>
    <p class="lead">Unconscious motives, early relationships, and defence mechanisms beneath the surface.</p>

    <div class="gallery">
      <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81GqKKrM2nL._AC_SY679_.jpg" alt="Sheldon with family" loading="lazy">

    </div>

    <p>
      Psychodynamic theory explores how early experiences and unconscious conflicts shape present behaviour. 
      Sheldon’s intense need for order and predictability can be viewed as a way of managing underlying anxiety—an ego strategy that keeps emotions contained so that intellect can dominate. 
      His strong bond with his mother provides security and a clear moral framework (a firm superego), while his wish for independence and recognition creates tension with authority figures, negotiated by the ego.
    </p>
    <p>
      Defence mechanisms are visible in everyday moments. 
      <em>Intellectualisation</em> is his favourite: when stressed, he turns feelings into problems to analyse, stripping away emotion and replacing it with logic. 
      <em>Rationalisation</em> (inventing logical reasons for choices already made) and <em>projection</em> (ascribing motives to others) occasionally appear when social situations confuse him. 
      These mechanisms reduce discomfort but can distance him from empathy and spontaneity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early experiences with praise for correctness may have created unconscious expectations that love is conditional on achievement. 
      This can produce perfectionism and fear of humiliation, explaining why surprises feel threatening and why he clings to rituals. 
      Mentors serve as symbolic father-figures; success with them satisfies deep wishes for approval, while disagreements can feel like personal rejection, eliciting disproportionate reactions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The psychodynamic lens doesn’t claim that Sheldon consciously chooses rigidity; rather, it suggests that hidden motives and childhood patterns quietly guide him. 
      Its value lies in revealing meaning behind habits—why order soothes him, why intellect becomes armour, and why relationships can be both cherished and puzzling. 
      The limitation is testability: unconscious processes are hard to measure. 
      Still, as a narrative of inner life, the approach explains Sheldon’s blend of brilliance, anxiety, and heartfelt loyalty.

    <h3>Cognitive Approach</h3>
    <p class="lead">How Sheldon thinks: schemas, memory systems, and problem-solving strategies.</p>

    <div class="gallery">
      <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81nktJ5Gk-L._AC_SY679_.jpg" alt="Sheldon with books" loading="lazy">

      <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Yh7z5mPzL._AC_SY679_.jpg" alt="Sheldon smiling" loading="lazy">
    </div>

    <p>
      The cognitive approach explains behaviour by examining internal mental processes—attention, memory, language, and reasoning. 
      Sheldon’s mind excels at building precise <em>schemas</em> (mental frameworks) for mathematics, physics, and daily routines. 
      These schemas organise new information quickly, allowing him to recognise patterns and retrieve rules at remarkable speed. 
      Powerful working memory lets him juggle steps in complex problems, while long-term memory stores formulas, facts, and examples in well-indexed “maps.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He also demonstrates sophisticated metacognition: he thinks about how he thinks. 
      He plans study schedules, tests himself, and monitors errors, choosing strategies—like chunking, visualising, or rehearsal—that boost accuracy. 
      Algorithms appeal to him because they minimise ambiguity; given clear inputs, he can produce reliable outputs. 
      When tasks lack rules, however, his rigid schemas can slow adaptation. 
      Figurative language or shifting social norms violate expectations, so he searches for explicit rules and sometimes misreads intentions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Attention is another strength and constraint. 
      He can hyper-focus on problems, filtering distractions, which accelerates expertise. 
      Yet rapid switching or noisy settings overload his system, reducing flexibility. 
      Cognitive biases also appear: confirmation bias (preferring evidence that fits existing theories) and anchoring (clinging to first impressions) occasionally colour judgments, especially in social contexts where data feel “messy.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, the cognitive lens highlights a mind optimised for structure: brilliant at rule-governed reasoning, memory organisation, and deliberate practice; less comfortable with ambiguity and implicit cues. 
      Understanding these strengths and limits explains both Sheldon’s academic superpowers and his social misunderstandings—and suggests why gentle scaffolding and clear expectations help him thrive.
