    <h3>Behaviourist Approach</h3>
    <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91I6U+Xy+RL._AC_SY679_.jpg" alt="Young Sheldon Behaviourist">
    <p>
      The behaviourist approach focuses on observable behaviour and how it is influenced by the environment through reinforcement, punishment, and conditioning. Young Sheldon demonstrates many examples of this approach. In the classroom, when Sheldon answers a question correctly, the praise he receives acts as a reward, increasing the likelihood that he will repeat the behaviour. Conversely, when corrected or disciplined, Sheldon shows frustration or avoidance, demonstrating how punishment can reduce undesirable behaviours. At home, his parents sometimes use rewards to encourage desired behaviours, such as extra privileges for completing chores or adhering to family routines. Behaviourism also explains Sheldon’s routines and habits: his repeated engagement with activities like solving complex math problems or memorizing scientific facts can be understood as behaviours reinforced over time. His reactions to stimuli, such as the anticipation of a reward or fear of disapproval, are measurable and predictable. Sheldon’s behaviour also reflects principles of operant conditioning: reinforcement strengthens his academic and intellectual habits, while punishment or lack of reward discourages non-preferred behaviours. Even seemingly small habits, such as his careful organization of objects or adherence to precise routines, demonstrate how past experiences with rewards or consequences have shaped his responses. By applying the behaviourist perspective, we can see how external factors influence Sheldon’s observable actions consistently, highlighting the role of environmental reinforcement and conditioning in shaping behaviour.

    <h3>Social Learning Approach</h3>

    <p>
      The social learning approach emphasizes learning through observation, imitation, and modelling rather than only through direct reinforcement. Young Sheldon provides many examples of this approach. He frequently observes his older brother, George, and his parents, learning how they solve problems, behave socially, and communicate ideas. Sheldon often imitates their behaviour to achieve desired outcomes, such as gaining approval or demonstrating knowledge. An example is when Sheldon copies George Sr.’s logical method of explanation to impress teachers or peers. He also observes the consequences of others’ actions—if someone receives praise for a certain behaviour, Sheldon is more likely to replicate it. This vicarious learning allows him to acquire new skills without direct practice. Sheldon’s attention to subtle social cues, like tone of voice or body language, also demonstrates observational learning. Social learning theory helps explain his social development, showing that he integrates observed behaviours from family and peers into his own repertoire. By watching how others navigate social situations and intellectual challenges, Sheldon adapts and refines his own behaviours, demonstrating that learning is not just a product of direct reinforcement but also of careful observation and imitation.

    <h3>Biological Approach</h3>
    <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81F+8fYQpZL._AC_SY679_.jpg" alt="Young Sheldon Biological">
    <p>
      The biological approach examines how genetics, brain development, neurochemistry, and inherited traits influence behaviour. Young Sheldon’s exceptional intelligence and memory are examples of innate biological factors. His ability to retain large amounts of information, understand complex scientific concepts, and solve advanced mathematical problems at a young age suggests strong genetic influences and neurodevelopmental advantages. Biological explanations can also be applied to his sensory sensitivities, attention to detail, and emotional responses, which may reflect natural predispositions. Neurobiological processes, such as efficient information processing and rapid problem-solving, underlie Sheldon’s cognitive abilities. By examining these behaviours biologically, we gain insight into the genetic and neural contributions to his exceptional talents. His consistent routines, logical approach, and high level of intellectual performance indicate that some aspects of his behaviour are influenced by inherited traits and innate brain functioning. Understanding Sheldon biologically allows us to see how natural abilities interact with environmental experiences to shape observable behaviour, highlighting the role of nature in combination with nurture.

    <h3>Psychodynamic Approach</h3>
    <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81GqKKrM2nL._AC_SY679_.jpg" alt="Young Sheldon Psychodynamic">
    <p>
      The psychodynamic approach emphasizes unconscious processes, early childhood experiences, and family dynamics in shaping behaviour. Young Sheldon exhibits several behaviours that can be explored psychodynamically. His strict adherence to routines, need for order, and occasional anxiety in social situations may be linked to unconscious conflicts and internalized parental expectations. Sheldon’s relationships with family members influence his behaviour: his drive to excel academically may be motivated by a desire for parental approval and unconscious impulses to achieve recognition. Concepts such as the id, ego, and superego help explain his behaviour—his id seeks pleasure and personal interests, his superego imposes learned rules and expectations, and his ego mediates between them to decide the appropriate course of action. Sheldon’s repetitive habits and compulsions may serve as coping mechanisms for managing unconscious tension and anxiety. Exploring his behaviour through a psychodynamic lens allows us to understand how past experiences, unconscious desires, and family dynamics contribute to observable traits, emotional regulation, and social interactions. This approach highlights the internal psychological forces driving his unique behaviour.
